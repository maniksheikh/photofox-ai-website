          requires a different
          number of credits per
          use. The figures
          shown represent
          the
          maximum number of generations possible if all credits are used for a single model type. In practice, you'll
          likely use a mix of models, allowing for diverse creations within your credit limit. For example, using
          credits for SketchToImage(v2) will leave fewer credits available for video generation or upscaling. This
          flexible system lets you allocate credits based on your specific needs. For a detailed breakdown of credit
          costs per model use, please click on the <span>ðŸ’° Cost</span> link in navbar.
